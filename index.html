            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I am a skilled and motivated professional with a background in computer science, data science, and AI, holding a Master’s in 
                AI in Data Science from Eastern Kentucky University and a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Meru University. 
                I have experience in programming (Python, R, Java, C#), machine learning (PyTorch, Scikit-learn), and data visualization 
                (Matplotlib, Seaborn). I have also worked in IT system management and end-user support in healthcare, improving efficiency and
                user satisfaction. Eager to expand my skills, I am excited to dive into web development and learn new technologies. 
                My experience with networking and database management complements my drive to make an impact in data science, AI, and web 
                development.
